Once your phone is unlocked, you can use it with any other carrier. Many carriers offer lower-cost plans and you can take advantage of these prices without sacrificing quality.\nFinally, you’ll want to make sure to keep your phone up to date. Unlocked phones don’t always get the same updates as carrier-locked phones. Keep an eye on your phone’s system updates and when they become available, install them to ensure that you are always enjoying the best user experience.\n1. What is an Unlocked Phone?

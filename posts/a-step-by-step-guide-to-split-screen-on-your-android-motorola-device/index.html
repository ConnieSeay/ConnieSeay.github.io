Using Split Screen on Motorola Android<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-using-split-screen-on-motorola-android>#</a></h3><p>Using the split screen feature on Android Motorola devices can be a great way to increase your productivity. First, open two apps that you would like to use – for example, your email and your browser. Then, press and hold the Recent Apps button on the bottom of your device&rsquo;s screen. This will open up a list of your currently open apps. From here, you can select two apps and tap the Split Screen button. Alternatively, you can drag and drop one of the apps to the top of the screen. This will split the screen into two separate parts, allowing you to use both apps at the same time. To exit out of the split screen mode, simply drag the divider up or down to close one of the two apps. With this, you can quickly and easily multitask on your Android Motorola device.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YIGdC-nOOis style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What is Split Screen on Android?</p><p>A1: Split Screen on Android is a feature that allows you to open multiple apps at the same time on your Android device and multitask with ease.

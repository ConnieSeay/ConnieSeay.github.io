Then, open the charging case, press and hold the pairing button located in the back of the case, and wait for the LED status light to start flashing white. Then, on your Android device, go to Settings and select Bluetooth. You should see your Airpods Pro listed. Select your Airpods Pro and your Android device will connect without the need of a case. If Android still prompts you to add a case, try disconnecting and reconnecting your Airpods Pro. This should allow them to connect directly. Additionally, make sure that all the software updates are up to date on both devices. This should help ensure a successful connection.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2dl5U7onBQ style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.

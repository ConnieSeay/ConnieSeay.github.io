Once you’ve got it downloaded on your phone, all you need to do is open the app and point your camera towards the QR code you want to scan.\nThe next step is to align your focus properly and make sure the scanner is properly detecting the QR code.

It can be a link to a website, a text, an image, or a video.\nAnother way to check if your phone is capable of scanning QR Codes is to use an online QR code reader.
